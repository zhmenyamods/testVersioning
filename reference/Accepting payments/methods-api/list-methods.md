title: List payment methods
excerpt: >-
  Retrieve all enabled payment methods. The results of this endpoint are **not**
  paginated — unlike most other list endpoints in our API.


  For test mode, all pending and enabled payment methods are returned. If no
  payment methods are requested yet, the most popular payment methods are
  returned in the test mode. For live mode, only fully enabled payment methods
  are returned.


  Payment methods can be requested and enabled via the Mollie Dashboard, or via
  the [Enable payment method endpoint](enable-method) of the Profiles API.


  The list can optionally be filtered using a number of parameters described
  below.


  By default, only payment methods for the Euro currency are returned. If you
  wish to retrieve payment methods which exclusively support other currencies
  (e.g. Twint), you need to use the `amount` parameters.
